They say Motivation is good but Discipline is better. Guess what beats discipline. Systems.

Here, we have a system that forces me to listen to a chapter of the Bible per day. It starts with an alarm (randomly selected music from 25 favourite music files), downloads the chapter, converts it to mp3, plays it, and then deletes it. It's not very efficient, but it works.
